This is my first Kaggle competition, and i just use Random Forest and XGBoost classifier to implement this along with lot of Data Preprocessing steps and  and Feature Engneering. 
My AUCROC score is 77.98 , which is pretty good but I still working on this and try improve it. My rank was 3.5k among 1M participants.
